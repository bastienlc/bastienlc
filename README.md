### Academic work and projects

* [MVA-Labs](https://github.com/bastienlc/MVA-Labs): labs for the MVA master.
* [CPOP](https://github.com/bastienlc/CPOP): a python implementation of the CPOP algorithm to detect changepoints in a univariate time series.
* [SBM-EM](https://github.com/bastienlc/SBM-EM): an implementation of a variational EM algorithm for the stochastic block model in pytorch.
* [altegrad-challenge](https://github.com/bastienlc/altegrad-challenge): our solution to a challenge on molecule retrieval with natural language queries.
* [NOT](https://github.com/bastienlc/NOT): a small project where we reproduce the results of a paper on neural networks for optimal transport.
* [MOPSI](https://github.com/bastienlc/MOPSI): integer linear programming for a students housing problem.

### Personal projects
* [pdf-watermark](https://github.com/bastienlc/pdf-watermark): a small python CLI to add watermarks to a pdf.
